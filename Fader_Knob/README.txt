# Summary

A replacement fader knob for a Radio Shack 5-channel mixer (model 32-1200A) but can be customized to change the look, or work with other sizes of fader.  

The OpenSCAD source is moderately parametric, so this is easily customizable, but the customization for the indicator line on top doesn't seem to work with customizer :(  

You can change the size of the top or bottom rectangle, change the index line in the top, or adjust the size of the cutout in the bottom to fit your console.  

Yes, it's simple and easy - in its default form, it is a perfect drop-in replacement for the classic Radio Shack 5 channel mixer.  



# Instructions

Made by measuring an original (broken) fader knob and making a part to match in OpenSCAD.  

Just print and use!  
I used 33.3% rounded infill with KISSlicer, which leaves the slot with enough resiliency that the knob slides firmly onto the mixer and will not come off easily.  
   
You can paint the line in the top to make it stand out. Sand with coarse, then fine sandpaper for a smooth surface. Rub it on a block of paraffin and polish it for a shiny finish.
